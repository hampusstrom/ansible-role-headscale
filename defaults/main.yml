# Version of Headscale to download and install
# When using the 'latest' tag,
# the role will automatically try to get the latest release tag from GitHub repo juanfont/Headscale
# this is not always going to work, and if you run this role a lot you might hit the github API rate limit
# 60 queries per hour.
# if you want stability I recommend tagging a specific release version, without the 'v' prefix.
# I.e. 'v0.16.4' should be defined as '0.16.4'
